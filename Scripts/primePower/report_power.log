ARGUMENTS
       -net_power
              Use this option to generate the net-based power report.

       -cell_power
              Use this option to generate the cell-based power report.

       -threshold_voltage_group
              Use  this option to report the leakage power per voltage thresh-
              old group, instead of reporting the number of cells per  voltage
              threshold  group  using  the report_threshold_voltage_group com-
              mand.  You can also use this  option  in  conjunction  with  the
              standard filtering options such as -clocks, -groups, and -rail.

       -lvth_groups low_vth_list
              Use  this option to specify the list of threshold voltage groups
              to be considered as low threshold  voltage.  The  value  of  the
              argument  is a list of threshold voltage group identifiers. Each
              identifier is a non-empty string that might consist of  alphanu-
              meric  characters  and  the  underscore character ("_"). If this
              option is omitted, no low threshold voltage groups  are  identi-
              fied  with  the  "L"  attribute.  This option is valid only with
              -threshold_voltage_group option.

       -leaf  Use this option to indicate that the power report must  traverse
              the  hierarchy  and report the nets or cells at lower-levels (as
              if the design's hierarchy were flat). The default is  to  report
              objects  at  only  the  current level of hierarchy. When you use
              this option in combination with the -levels  option,  the  lower
              levels  of  the design hierarchy are traversed only to the depth
              you have specified.

       -include_boundary_nets
              Use this option to indicate that the switching power of  primary
              input nets must be counted when generating the power report; the
              default is to exclude boundary input nets.

       -verbose
              Use this option to report verbose  information,  mainly  in  the
              header  of  the  report, such as operating conditions, wire load
              models used to calculate power and the power unit information.

       -nworst number
              Use this option to filter the report so that  it  displays  only
              the  top-most  number  of  the nets or cells sorted by a certain
              type of sort method.

       -sort_by sort_method
              Use this option to specify the sorting mode for the net or  cell
              order in the power report.

       -nosplit
              Use  this  option to prevent line-splitting or section-breaking.
              By default, if the information for a  given  field  exceeds  its
              fixed  column width, the next field begins on a new line, start-
              ing in the correct column (line-splitting).  By default, if  the
              information  for  one  line  exceeds the 80 character limit, the
              report is broken into two sections, each containing part of  the
              information (section-breaking).

       -hierarchy
              Use this option to generate the hierarchy-based power report.

       -levels level
              Use  this option to specify the number of hierarchy levels to be
              displayed in the hierarchy-based power report. When you use  the
              -leaf  option,  the number of levels to traverse for the net and
              cell based report is also specified.

       -power_greater_than threshold
              Use this option to report only the  nets  or  cells  with  total
              power value equal to or greater than threshold value.

       -clocks clock_list
              Use this option to report only the nets, cells, or both nets and
              cells  that  belong  to  the  clock  domains  specified  by  the
              clock_list value.

       -groups group_list
              Use this option to report only the nets, cells, or both nets and
              cells  that  belong  to  the  power  groups  specified  by   the
              group_list value.

       -include_estimated_clock_network
              Use  this option to include the clock network power estimated by
              the estimate_clock_network_power command in the power report.

       -derate
              Use this option to include the effective power derate factors in
              the cell reports.  It does not affect other types of reports.

       -rails rails_supply_nets_name
              Use  this option to specify a list of supply nets under UPF mode
              or design rails under rail mapping mode for which the power val-
              ues are reported.

       -pattern_priority pattern_list
              Specifies  the  list  of patterns of cell name (or its attribute
              value) to be processed  for  generating  the  threshold  voltage
              group leakage report.

       -attribute attribute_name_for_cell_pattern
              Specifies  the  attribute name, whose values are processed based
              on the pattern_priority list for generating the threshold  volt-
              age group leakage report.

       -pst   Use  this  option to report power for valid power state combina-
              tions defined at the top level design.

       -relative_toggle_rate
              Use this option with -net_power  option.  When  this  option  is
              used,  the  toggle  rate specifies the relative toggle rate with
              respect to the related clock for the given design object.

       -significant_digits digits
              Specifies the number of digits of precision to be  displayed  by
              warnings  that  show  floating point numbers. Allowed values are
              0-13; the default is 4.

       -include_shutdown_cells
              Use this option to report shutdown cells as well for valid power
              state combinations defined at the top level design.

       -separate_glitch_power
              Allows  the  user  to report glitch power components of internal
              and  switching  power  separately  .   This  option   works   in
              time_based         mode         when         the        variable
              "power_enable_clock_cycle_based_glitch" is enabled.   When  this
              option  is  enabled  , for each cell or power group 2 additional
              columns are reported for glitch internal  and  glitch  switching
              power.  The regular internal and switching power columns exclude
              glitch power components.This feaure  enabled,  for  each  net  2
              additional  columns  are  reported  for  glitch  rate and glitch
              switching power.

       -separate_glitch_power_component
              This  option  works  in  time_based  mode  when   the   variable
              "power_enable_clock_cycle_based_glitch"  is  enabled.  When this
              option is enabled , for each cell or power  group  2  additional
              columns  are  reported  for glitch inertial and glitch transport
              power.  The regular internal and switching power columns include
              glitch power components.

       -through_switch
              Use  this  option  along  with -rail option.  Allows the user to
              report power associated with the supply_net after getting propa-
              gated through the switches.

       -include_lib_cells
              Use  this option to report library cell name along with the cell
              names.  -cell or -cell_power option is mandatory to be added  to
              the command to use this option.

       -separate_switching_power
              Allows the user to split switching power into wire power and pin
              power.   Generates  net-based  wire,  pin  and  switching  power
              report.

       -area  Use this option to report cell area along with the cell-based or
              hierarchy-based power report.  -cell_power or -hierarchy  option
              is mandatory to be added to the command to use this option.

       -exclude_wire_load_info
              Use  this option along with -verbose option to exclude wire load
              models from the verbose report.

       -compact_view
              Use this option for compact view of cell and  rail  based  power
              report.

       -per_clock per_Iclock_list
              Use  this  option  for  design based report of each of the clock
              domain specified in  the  per_clock_list  value.  No  any  other
              option should be provided with this for reporting.

       object_list
              Use  this option to specify a list of cells, nets, or both to be
              displayed in the cell-based, net-based, or both cell-  and  net-
              based power report.

DESCRIPTION
       Use the report_power command to generate a power report. It can be used
       in nondistributed power analysis or distributed power analysis.  In the
       distributed  power  analysis, the command in the manager process has no
       options and only generates a merged power report for  top  design.  The
       following  description  is  for  the  normal distributed power analysis
       (nondistributed power analysis or usage in workers of distributed power
       analysis).

       Generates  power  reports  for  the design or a specific hierarchy. The
       specific hierarchy  is  determined  by  the  current_instance  command.
       Before  generating  the  report, power information is updated if neces-
       sary.

       Four types of power reports can be  generated:  summary  report,  cell-
       based report, net-based report, and hierarchy-based report.

   Summary Power Report
       When  none  of  the  -cell_power, -net_power, or -hierarchy options are
       specified, a summary power  report  is  generated.  The  summary  power
       report  displays internal, leakage, switching, and total power, as well
       as peak power, peak time, glitching power, and X transition  power,  if
       available,  for the current instance, or the current design if the cur-
       rent instance is the top hierarchy of the current design.  The  summary
       power  report  also reports power for each power group. By default, all
       instances are placed in only one power group; so the summation  of  the
       power  of  the  predefined groups equals the total power consumption of
       the design.

       There are seven predefined power groups:
       o io_pad: Cells defined as part of the pad_cell group in the library.
       o memory: Cells defined as part of the memory group in the library.
       o black_box: Cells with no functional description in the library.
       o clock_network: Cells in the clock_network excluding io_pad cells.
       o register: Latches and flip-flops driven by the clock network  exclud-
         ing io_pads and black_boxes.
       o combinational: Nonsequential cells with a functional description.
       o  sequential:  Latches  and  flip-flops  clocked by signals other than
         those in the clock network.

       See the Power Group Power Reporting section.

       To report the total  leakage  breakdowns,  set  the  power_report_leak-
       age_breakdowns variable to true.

   Cell-Based Power Report
       When  you  specify  the  -cell_power  option,  the  cell-based power is
       reported.  The cell-based power report has two  sections:  Section  one
       displays  the  cell internal power, cell leakage power, switching power
       of nets driven by the cell, total power, and percentage of total  power
       compared with the overall power of all cells displayed in the report.

       Section  two  reports the peak power, peak time, glitching power, and X
       transition power. Section two only shows up when there are peak  power,
       glitching power, X transition power, or both.

       When  you  specify  the  -nosplit  option,  the two sections are merged
       together.  The peak power for a cell is only available if the  waveform
       is  created  for this cell.  For more information, see the update_power
       man page.

       By default, only cells (including hierarchical cells) in current  hier-
       archy are displayed. The power information displayed for a hierarchical
       cell is the total effect of all leaf cells contained by the  hierarchi-
       cal cell.

       If  the  power_report_leakage_breakdowns  variable  is  set to true, an
       additional section of leakage breakdowns is also be printed out.

       If the -derate option is specified along with the  -cell_power  option,
       effective  power  derate factors are included in the power reports. The
       effective power derate factors are the ratio of derated power to under-
       rated  power of a cell. Power components with zero power derate factors
       are excluded from calculating effective power derate factors. In such a
       case, a 'z' attribute is added to the corresponding cell.

       If you use the set_power_analysis_options command with the -sdpd_track-
       ing option, the report shows an additional attribute flag "s" for those
       cells whose state-dependent and path-dependent (SDPD) switching activi-
       ties are tracked.

       If  the  -include_lib_cells  option  is  specified   along   with   the
       -cell_power option, library cell names are reported along with the cell
       name.

   Net-Based Power Report
       When  you  specify  the  -net_power  option,  the  net-based  power  is
       reported.   The  net-based  power  report displays VDD, total net load,
       static probability, toggle rate, and net switching power.

       By default, only nets in the current hierarchy are  displayed.  If  you
       use  the -leaf option, the report would traverse down all lower hierar-
       chies and report all nets found in each hierarchy.   When  you  specify
       the  object_list option, only the nets in the object_list are reported.
       If a net has more than one net segment in different  hierarchies,  only
       the net segment in the top most hierarchy is listed in the report.

   Hierarchy-Based Power Report
       When  you  specify  the -hierarchy option, the hierarchy-based power is
       reported. The report would be in  a  hierarchical  format,  with  power
       information  on  a block-by-block basis. The hierarchy is shown through
       indentations. The -levels option specifies  the  number  of  levels  of
       hierarchy to be displayed. Hierarchy levels deeper than the ones speci-
       fied in this option are not shown in the report. If the -leaf option is
       specified, the leaf cell reference names are to be reported.

       For each hierarchical block, the switching, internal, and leakage power
       are reported, as well as the total power and the  percentage  of  total
       power  compared  with  the  overall power of the top hierarchy. The top
       hierarchy is determined  by  current_instance.  Hierarchy-based  report
       also  has  a second section to display peak power, peak time, glitching
       power, and X transition power, when necessary. Similarly, if the  -nos-
       plit  option  is  specified, the two sections are merged together. Peak
       power for the hierarchy is only available if the  waveform  is  created
       for this hierarchy.

       For more information, see the update_power man page.

   Rail and Supply Nets Based Power Reports
       When  you  specify the -rails option, only the power reports associated
       with the specified rails or  supply  nets  are  generated.  The  -rails
       option accepts a list of name strings. Each name string can contain one
       or more rail or power supply net names separated by  space.  One  power
       report  is generated for each name string if it contains valid rails or
       supply nets. If the name string contains "all" keyword, a report of all
       rails  is  generated.  Multiple power reports can be generated by using
       the report_power command with different combinations of rail  names  in
       the   list.   The  -rails  option  works  with  other  options  of  the
       report_power command to generate  cell,  hierarchical,  or  group-based
       power  reports.  For  time-based power analysis, peak power reports are
       always for all rails, regardless of the rail specification.

   Negative Power Reporting
       When you specify the -power_greater_than option along with an appropri-
       ate  negative  threshold  value  with  the -cell_power option, the leaf
       cells with negative power are reported.

   Sorting and Filtering
       When you specify a certain sort mode with the -sort_by option, the list
       of  cell  and  nets in the cell- based or net-based power report can be
       sorted.  The available sorting modes for the -net_power or  -cell_power
       option as following:

          -net_power option         -cell_power option
          -----------------         ------------------
          name                      name
          net_static_probability    cell_internal_power
          net_switching_power       cell_leakage_power
          net_toggle_rate           dynamic_power
          total_net_load            total_power
          total_power

       If  both  the  -net_power  and  -cell_power options are specified and a
       sorting mode is explicitly selected, the selected sorting mode is  used
       for  both the cell and nets reports. Therefore, you must select a sort-
       ing mode that applies to both the -net_power and -cell_power options.

       When reporting with the -hierarchical option, the  same  sorting  modes
       are available as the -cell_power option.  The report is first sorted by
       hierarchy and then sorted by the requested sorting  method,  preserving
       the hierarchical structure of the report.

       If the sorting mode is not explicitly set, a default is chosen based on
       the mode of the report_power command:

             Mode                          Implicit default
             ----------                    ------------------

             -net_power -cell_power        dynamic_power

       The sorted list of the cells and nets in the cell-based  and  net-based
       power  report  can  be  filtered to display only the top most number of
       cells or nets specified by the -nworst option.

   Clock Domain Power Reporting
       When you specify the clock_list value with the -clocks option, a  power
       report  is  generated  for  the  cells  and nets in the specified clock
       domains.

       The cells and nets in the clock tree network of CLK clock are taken  as
       belonging  to  CLK  clock  domain.  The cells and nets in a timing path
       launched by the CLK clock  are  regarded  as  belonging  to  CLK  clock
       domain.   The cells and nets in a timing path with no launch clock, but
       captured by the CLK clock are regarded as belonging to  the  CLK  clock
       domain as well.  If a cell or net belongs to multiple clock domains, it
       is forced to belong to the clock domain with the fastest  clock.  If  a
       cell  or net belongs to no clock domains, it is forced to belong to the
       fastest clock domain in the design.

       The power for the design or a hierarchy is no longer the  total  effect
       of  all  leaf  cells in the design or hierarchy, but instead, the total
       effect of all leaf cells that are in the design or hierarchy AND belong
       to the specified clock domains.

       Clock  domain  power  reporting supports all of the four types of power
       report.

   Power Group Power Reporting
       When you specify the group_list value with the -groups option, a  power
       report  is  generated  for  the  cells  and nets in the specified clock
       domains.

       Power groups can be created by the create_power_group command. The tool
       has also several predefined power groups. For more information, see the
       create_power_group man page.

       The power for the design or a hierarchy is no longer the  total  effect
       of  all  leaf  cells in the design or hierarchy, but instead, the total
       effect of all leaf cells that are in the design or hierarchy AND belong
       to the specified power groups.

       Power  group  power  reporting  supports all of the four types of power
       report.  In the summary power report, if  the  -groups  option  is  not
       specified, all the power groups are reported. For each power group, the
       cumulative switching, internal, and leakage power of  the  power  group
       are  reported,  as  well  as  the total power and the percentage of the
       total power compared with the overall power of the top  hierarchy.  The
       top  hierarchy  is  determined  by  current_instance.  This power group
       report also has a second section to display the peak power, peak  time,
       glitching power, and X transition power, when necessary.

       Similarly,  if  the  -nosplit option is specified, the two sections are
       merged together. Peak power for the power group is  only  available  if
       the waveform is created for this power group. For more information, see
       the update_power man  page.Option  -nosplit  is  supported  along  with
       option -significant_digits.

   Clock Tree Power Reporting
       Clock  tree  power and register (driven by the clock tree) power can be
       reported using the report_power command by using the power group  power
       reporting.   There  are  two predefined power groups: clock_network and
       register. The clock_network power group contains all cells in the clock
       tree network. The register power group contains all registers driven by
       the clock tree network.

       The        power_clock_network_include_clock_gating_network         and
       power_clock_network_include_register_clock_pin_power    variables   can
       affect clock tree power reporting. For more information,  see  the  man
       pages.

       The  clock tree power reporting supports all of the four types of power
       report.  By default, the summary power report  displays  power  of  the
       predefined  clock_network and register power groups. An attribute label
       "i" is used to indicate whether the  clock_network  or  register  power
       group  includes  the  register clock pin power. In the cell-based power
       report, an attribute label "c" is used to indicate that only clock  pin
       internal  power  is  displayed  for  the register cell; a "d" attribute
       label is used to indicate that the power  displayed  for  the  register
       cell does not include the register clock pin internal power.

       The  clock  tree  power  for  certain clocks (if not all clocks) can be
       reported by combining the -groups and -clocks options.

   Estimated Clock Tree Power Reporting
       Clock tree power and register (driven by the clock  tree)  power  esti-
       mated  using  the  estimate_clock_network_power command can be reported
       using the -include_estimated_clock_network option. Estimated clock tree
       power  can  only  be  reported  in  the  Summary Report; therefore, the
       -cell_power and -net_power options cannot be  specified  together  with
       the -include_estimated_clock_network option.

       The  power  of  the  existing clock tree network, if any, is subtracted
       from the total power, and the power of the estimated clock  tree  power
       is added.  If the estimated clock tree power includes register power by
       using the estimate_clock_network_power -include_registers command,  the
       power  of the existing registers is subtracted from the total power and
       the power of the estimated register power is  added.  Accordingly,  the
       power  for  the  power  groups "clock_network" and "register" should be
       affected. These power groups do not  include  estimated  clock  network
       power. However, the power for the existing clock network is subtracted.

       A  new  section in the Summary power report section shows the estimated
       clock network power for each clock that has been estimated.  The  esti-
       mate_clock_network_power  command  must be used before the report_power
       command. Multiple estimate_clock_network_power commands  can  be  used,
       but  only  the  power from the latest command that estimates clock tree
       power for a certain clock is reported by the report_power command.

       The -clocks  option  can  be  specified  together  with  -include_esti-
       mated_clock_network  option.  In  this  case, only the clock tree power
       estimated for the specified clocks is included in the power report.

       The -groups  option  can  be  specified  together  with  -include_esti-
       mated_clock_network  option.  In this case, only when the clock_network
       and register power groups are specified, the  estimated  clock  network
       power is reported.

   Low-Level Hierarchy Power Reporting
       Power  reports  can  be  generated for the top design and a lower-level
       hierarchy.  The hierarchy can be determined by  current_instance.   The
       power  reports  for  the top design are special cases, when the current
       instance is the top-level hierarchy of  the  design.   If  the  current
       instance  is  not the top design, only the cells or nets under the cur-
       rent instance are targeted for power reporting.

       To generate different power reports for each clock domain, power group,
       and  hierarchy,  combine the -clocks and -groups options with using the
       current_instance command.

   PST based Power Reports
       When you specify the -pst option, PST based power analysis reports  are
       generated.   It reports power for valid power state combinatios defined
       at the top level design.   This  feature  requires  that  the  variable
       upf_enable_pst is set to true before load_upf. Option -pst can be spec-
       ified with other report_power options to generate cell and hierarchical
       power reports. But it cann't be specified with -rails option. These two
       reportng features are mutually exclusive.
